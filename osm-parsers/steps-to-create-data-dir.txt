1) cp -r 090916-data data (contains sports, colleges, etc.)

OR
2) cp -r 090916-osm/ data/ (copy over pre-generated data since parsing all .pbf files can take a long time)

3) ruby usa-census.rb (overwrite cities and counties for US states since census is better data) (requires states.txt, national_places.txt)
